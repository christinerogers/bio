Christine Rogers is a Research Project Officer at the McGill Centre of Integrative Neuroscience ([MCIN](http://mcin.ca)) at the Montreal Neurological Institute. She serves as the Lead of several open-source neuroinformatics initiatives with the [LORIS open database](http:/LORIS.ca) team, and currently contributes expertise to the management of the [Global Brain Consortium](http://globalbrainconsortium.org) and [EEGNet](http://EEGNet.org), a Canadian-funded initiative to build gold-standard open annotated datasets and processing workflows in electrophysiology for accessible global standards and applications in global health. Her open science leadership roles have included platforms and initiatives such as the [MNI Open iEEG Atlas](https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca), the Open Sleep Atlas, and more.

Her technical work has largely focused on integration of data workflows and modalities for genomics and electrophysiology into online data platforms for remote collaboration, in domains such as autism, epilepsy, stroke, and more. Her experience includes industry and research software development and production, including 10 years in open-source.

She has mentored 6 times for Google Summer of Code and Season of Docs programs for open-source software projects, with the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF](https://incf.org)). 
Most recently, she has taken on the Global Brain Consortium remote events leadership and execution, and was an invited presenter and mentor at the Neuro's Open Science in Action 2020 conference.
